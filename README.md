### Mutanos is a dummy landing page done for an imaginary restaurant it assumes a format which would be similar to what an actual restaurant website would look like on loading the webpage, the first thing the user would see would be the meal of the day, the image of the dish and the price and a link to order the meal of the day. The next section shows the two differnet categories of thr dishes served at the restaurant which are the local and international dishes, clicking on the cards will lead you to seeing all the various dishes available. the last section contains brief introduction of the lead chef at the restaurant.
